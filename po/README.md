# Translations

This directory contains translation files (.po/.pot) for the application.

## How to contribute translations

**All translations are managed via [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/danielnylander/ubuntu-l10n/).**

Please do **not** submit pull requests with .po file changes directly — they will be overwritten by the Transifex sync.

### To translate:

1. Go to [app.transifex.com/danielnylander/ubuntu-l10n](https://app.transifex.com/danielnylander/ubuntu-l10n/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Choose your language and start translating

### How it works:

- Source strings (.pot) are pushed to Transifex automatically
- Translations are pulled back via GitHub Actions during releases
- The .po files in this directory are generated — do not edit them manually

Thank you for helping translate this app! 🌍
